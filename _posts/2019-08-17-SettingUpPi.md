Well that was easy! My first set-up of the Pi took about 20 minutes and was done through connecting everything up with our TV downstairs while dealing with two very inquisitive kids :)
  
I simply connected the HDMI cable, power cable, keyboard and mouse and turned it on. After following the very simple on-screen instructions the new OS (Raspbian buster) was loaded and we were ready to go. All very easy. SO easy in fact that within 2 minutes of start-up we were watching some cartoons from YouTube. It all worked like a dream and I couldn't believe how easy it was and also how well it played the video and sound. I didn't have to mess around with screen resolution or sound and it all worked perfectly. Almost easier than a mac even!
  
The next day we played a few online and python games. The online games played well, although some didn't quite render correctly, while the included python games were good but a bit too quick for my little one. I'm going to try to understand them and slow them down for her so she can play them. We also had a problem with sound this time, as it didn't seem to go through to the TV. I messed around trying to force the sound through the HDMI cable and in the end sorted it by configuring the resolution and sound of screen one (and swapping my HDMI cable into the other port). This seemed to fix everything so I celebrated by watching a friendly game of football between AS Roma and Arezzo via twitter. Playback was good for both video and sound, particularly as it was all coming from twitter.
   
So the Pi is doing well. So well in fact, that I've started writing these posts from it. All good so far.  

Notes:
* The Pi has already given me a few warnings about getting to hot and it seems the 'official' Raspberry Pi case doesn't help the chip breathe at all. The Pi got too hot while we were playing a game on one internet browser tab (with no other tabs open). I'm going to look into other cases with a heat sink.  
* The resolution/sound issue still isn't quite sorted so I'm going to look into the optimum resolution/audio without putting too much strain on the processor.  

*Personal note: I'll update this post shortly with photos*
